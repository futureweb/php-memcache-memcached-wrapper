# php-memcache-memcached-wrapper

This collection of memcache functions is trying to be a drop in replacement for the PHP memcache extension.
As memcache Extension isn't actively maintained this Wrapper implements the actively maintained memcached Extension below existing memcache Functions. This package is trying to support legacy projects without the need of having the memcache Extension installed by using this package you are not hold back to update to new PHP versions.

The return values of my Functions are aimed to match the memcache functions as close as possible.
